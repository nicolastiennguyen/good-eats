## About
Good Eats is an application which locates businesses near you using Yelp's API. You can search by keyword, category, location, price level, etc. There are also weekly favorites featured from the staff, as well as the ability to save businesses for later use. Inspired by answering the infamous question of "where should we eat?".



## Running Locally
Retrieve an API Key from https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started by navigating to General > Create App > Login > Manage App > API Key. From there, locate the .env file in this repository and fill in the required inputs.

Once that is complete:
```
npm install
```
Then, in two separate terminals:
```
npm run dev
npm run server-dev
```
